In some places, the trail completely hangs off very high and completely vertical mountain cliffs (in some cases balcony-type) with no fences or hand rails at all. At 1.4 miles from Nocelle, the trail forks into an upper and lower segments. The upper trail is less exposed, a bit more wooded/shaded, and it passes through a couple of farming terraces with great views. In some places you can see the lower trail. The lower trail is more exposed to the cliffs and offers stunning views of the sea and the little towns of Positano, Nocelle, Praiano and Arienzo. In Bomerano, and the point of return in this track, there is a restaurant with no name, with excellent local food and friendly service. \nThe trail starts at the <a href=\"http://www.villadeglidei.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Villa Degli Dei</a> -- turn left where there is a small shrine and a water fountain. To reach it, you need to walk down from the Nocelle parking through the town footpath and stairs (about 0.1 miles/200m). ",
