The Pororari river is very beautiful, almost magical, with its tea-colored waters gently flowing through an extremely lush rainforest and wonderful limestone formations. A good chunk of the loop is waking on the road, which is not all that great. But it is compensated with the amazing sights of the Pancake Rocks.",

The main goal is the fire lookout on top of the Bull of the Woods mountain, from which on a clear day you can enjoy a fantastic 360 view of the cascades: Mt Hood to the Northeast, Mt Jefferson to the Southeast and Mt Washington and Three Finger Jack to the South. There are also two small pretty lakes along the way and a lot of huckleberries and rhododendrons, both of which require the appropriate season to be fully appreciated -- early fall and late spring respectively. Oh, lets not forget, the trail passes through an old growth forest.",
