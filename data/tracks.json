			"trackDescription": "Beautiful hike up the Pororari river connecting with the Punakaiki river and passing through the Pancake Rocks. The Pororari river is very beautiful, almost magical, with its tea-colored waters gently flowing through an extremely lush rainforest and wonderful limestone formations. A good chunk of the loop is waking on the road, which is not all that great. But it is compensated with the amazing sights of the Pancake Rocks.",

			"trackName": "Bull of the Woods, near Estacada, Oregon",
			"trackDescription": "This is a loop hike in the remote Bull of the Woods wilderness area. The main goal is the fire lookout on top of the Bull of the Woods mountain, from which on a clear day you can enjoy a fantastic 360 view of the cascades: Mt Hood to the Northeast, Mt Jefferson to the Southeast and Mt Washington and Three Finger Jack to the South. There are also two small pretty lakes along the way and a lot of huckleberries and rhododendrons, both of which require the appropriate season to be fully appreciated -- early fall and late spring respectively. Oh, lets not forget, the trail passes through an old growth forest.",
